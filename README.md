# Ruby Meetup: Online

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/04251eba-2ebc-4071-bb77-31d392b6720c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ruby-meetup-online/deploys)

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Fork the repository, navigate into the site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd ruby-meetup-online
    yarn install
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `ruby-meetup-online` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
